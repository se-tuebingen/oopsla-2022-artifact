# Artifact for the OOPSLA 2022 paper 'Effects, Capabilities, and Boxes'

This github repository constitutes the artifact for our paper

> Effects, Capabilities, and Boxes: From Scope-based Reasoning to Type-based Reasoning and Back.
> Jonathan Immanuel BrachthÃ¤user, Philipp Schuster, Edward Lee, Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki.
> Conditionally accepteed at OOPSLA 2022.

## Overview

The artifact consists of two parts:

1. `coq/`: Coq proofs, proving soundness of the calculus System C
2. `demo-sources/`: A website featuring an implementation of System C with examples that can be typechecked, edited, and run.

While the repository contains the sources of the website, we do not propose to
build the website yourself. Instead, we use github-pages (branch [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/se-tuebingen/oopsla-2022-artifact/tree/gh-pages)) to host the artifact, which is made available at:

  <https://se-tuebingen.github.io/oopsla-2022-artifact/>

The website contains

- [Documentation of the proofs](https://se-tuebingen.github.io/oopsla-2022-artifact/proofs/), with [detailed information](https://se-tuebingen.github.io/oopsla-2022-artifact/proofs/Top.SystemC.Definitions.html) on how the Coq mechanization corresponds to the calculus as it is presented in the paper.

- [An executable implementation](https://se-tuebingen.github.io/oopsla-2022-artifact/tutorial/) of the calculus.

We claim reusability of the proofs and the interactive demo, but not of the calculus _implementation_ itself.

### Additional Instructions
Please find additional instructions in the following two files:

- `GETTING-STARTED.md ` for the kick-the-tires phase.
- `STEP-BY-STEP.md` for suggestions on how to proceed with the evaluation of the artifact.
