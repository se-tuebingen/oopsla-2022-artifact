# Artifact for the OOPSLA 2022 paper 'Effects, Capabilities, and Boxes'

This github repository constitutes the artifact for our paper

> Effects, Capabilities, and Boxes: From Scope-based Reasoning to Type-based Reasoning and Back.
> Jonathan Immanuel BrachthÃ¤user, Philipp Schuster, Edward Lee, Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki.
> Conditionally accepteed at OOPSLA 2022.

The artifact consists of two parts:

1. Coq proofs, proving soundness of the calculus System C
2. A website featuring an implementation of System C with examples that can be typechecked, edited, and run.

## Getting Started
While the repository contains the sources of the website, we do not propose to
build the website yourselves. Instead, we use github-pages to host the artifact,
which is available at
