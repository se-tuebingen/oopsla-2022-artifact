# Effects, Capabilities, and Boxes

Welcome to our artifact website!

Our artifact consists of the following components:

- [**Coq Proofs**](proofs/). We documented our Coq proofs, highlighting the most important aspects and contrasting the definitions with the paper.
  We recommend you look at the [definitions](./proofs/Top.SystemC.Definitions.html) as well as at the [theorems](./proofs/Top.SystemC.Soundness.html).

- [**Interactive Demo**](tutorial/index.html). This website contains additional [casestudies](casestudies.html), [examples from the paper](paper.html),
  and additional explanation on [capabilities](capability) and [boxing](boxing). All examples can be typechecked and edited in the browser!
