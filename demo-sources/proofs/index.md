# Proofs

> **Disclaimer** Not all proof-files are equally well documented.

For the artifact, we carefully prepared the following files, which we recommend to look at.

## Definitions of Syntax, Typing, and Semantics
In file [Top.SystemC.Definitions.html](Top.SystemC.Definitions.html), you can inspect the Coq definitions and compare them with the paper's definition.

## Main Theorems
File [Top.SystemC.Soundness.html](Top.SystemC.Soundness.html) lists the main theorems.
